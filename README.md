### Acknowledgements
------------

Many thanks to the
[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) project
([github](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)), which is helping us all
spend less time molding and more time getting things baked.

This cookiecutter was developed abreast the awesome [Cookiecutter Data
Science](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
project ([github](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science)),
borrowing features from
[shablona](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona) (e.g. duecredit, travis CI)
and inspired by  the directory scaffold of
[Cookiecutter-Pytorch](https://github.com/khornlund/cookiecutter-pytorch).
