<p>The recommendations we make here follow the standards and conventions of much
of the scientific Python eco-system. Following these standards and
recommendations will make it easier for others to use your code, and can make
it easier for you to port your code into other projects and collaborate with
other users of this eco-system. Your analysis doesn't have to be in Python, but
the template does provide some Python boilerplate that you'd want to remove (in
the <code>package_name</code> folder for example, and the Sphinx documentation skeleton in
<code>docs</code>).</p>
<p>Disagree with a couple of the default folder names? Working on a project that's
a little nonstandard and doesn't exactly fit with the current structure? Prefer
to use a different package than one of the (few) defaults?</p>
<p><strong>Go for it!</strong> This is a lightweight structure, and is intended to be a good
starting point for many projects.</p>

<h2 id="repository-structure">Repository Structure</h2>
<hr />
<p>We now examine the newly created repository in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="environment-and-installation">Environment and Installation</h3>
<hr />
<p>The first step in reproducing an analysis is always reproducing the
computational environment it was run in. You need the same tools, the same
libraries, and the same versions to make everything play nicely together.</p>
<p>One effective approach to this is use a virtual environment . We included a
target in the Makefile (<code>make create_environment</code>) which will create a <code>conda</code>
(see <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html"><code>Miniconda</code></a> software
distribution, not to be confused with
<a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/"><code>Anaconda</code></a>, though they are
similar and both produced by Continuum) environment if conda is installed, else
create a <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>
(<a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a> is
recommended for managing virtualenvs).</p>
<p>By listing all of your requirements in the repository (we include a
<code>requirements.txt</code> file) you can easily track the packages needed to recreate
the analysis. Here is a good workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>run <code>make create_environment</code> when creating a new project. This will create a <code>conda</code> environment if conda available, else create <code>virtualenv</code>.</li>
<li>run <code>conda activate project_name</code> (or <code>workon project_name</code>) to activate the virtual environment.</li>
<li><code>pip install</code>/<code>conda install</code> the packages that your analysis needs.</li>
<li>Run <code>conda list --export &gt; requirements.txt</code> (or <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code>) to pin the exact package versions used to recreate the analysis.</li>
<li>If you find you need to install another package, run <code>conda list --export &gt; requirements.txt</code> (or <code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code>) again and commit the changes to version control.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily duplicate your environment and the associated dependencies with <code>conda create --name &lt;env_name&gt; --file requirements.txt</code> (or <code>mkvirtualenv &lt;env_name&gt;; workon &lt;env_name&gt;; pip install -r requirements.txt</code>).</p>
<p>This awesome <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html#conda-vs-pip-vs-virtualenv-commands">conversion
table</a>
lists operation equivalences between <code>conda</code>, <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenv</code>. For more
on the differences between <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code>, see <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/">this
article</a>
by Jake VanderPlas.</p>
<p>If you have more complex requirements for recreating your environment, consider
a container-based approach such as <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> or
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. Both of these tools use text-based
formats (Dockerfile and Vagrantfile, respectively) you can easily add to source
control to describe how to create a container with the requirements you
need.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<hr />
<p>For installation and distribution we will use the python standard library
<code>setuptools</code> module. This module uses a <code>setup.py</code> file to figure out how to
install your software on a particular system. For a small project such as this
one, managing installation of the software modules and the data is rather
simple.</p>
<p>A <code>package_name/version.py</code> contains all of the information needed for the
installation and for setting up the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/shablona">PyPI
page</a> for the software. This also makes
it possible to install your software using <code>pip</code> and <code>easy_install</code>, which
are package managers for Python software. The <code>setup.py</code> file reads this
information from there and passes it to the <code>setup</code> function which takes care
of the rest.</p>
<p>Much more information on packaging Python software can be found in the
<a href="https://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.org">Hitchhiker's guide to
packaging</a>.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous integration</h3>
<p><img alt="continuous integration" src="continuous-integration.png" /></p>
<p>Travis-CI is a system that can be used to automatically test every revision of
your code directly from github, including testing of github pull requests,
before they are merged into the <code>master</code> branch. This provides you with
information needed in order to evaluate contributions made by others. It also
serves as a source of information for others interested in using or contributing
to your project about the degree of test coverage of your project.</p>
<p>You will need a .travis.yml file in your repo. This file contains the
configuration of your testing environment. This includes the different
environments in which you will test the source code (for example, we test
<code>package_name</code> against Python 2.7, Python 3.7 and Python 3.8). It includes steps
that need to be taken before installation of the software. For example,
installation of the software dependencies. For <code>package_name</code>, we use the
<a href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html"><code>Miniconda</code></a> software distribution (not
to be confused with <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/"><code>Anaconda</code></a>,
though they are similar and both produced by Continuum).</p>
<p>For details on setting up Travis-CI with github, see Travis-CI's
<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/#To-get-started-with-Travis-CI%3A">getting started
page</a>. To
summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to the Travis-CI <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">website</a> and get a
Travis user account, linked to your github user account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to set up your github repo to talk to Travis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will need to go back to travis-ci, and flip on the switch on that side as
well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The travis output will also report to you about test coverage, if you set it up
that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will start getting emails telling you the state of the testing suite on
every pull request for the software, and also when you break the test suite on
the <code>master</code> branch. That way, you can be pretty sure that the <code>master</code> is
working (or at least know when it isn't...).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also continuously test your code on a Windows system. This is done on
another CI system called <a href="http://www.appveyor.com/">Appveyor</a>. In prinicple, it
does something that is very similar to what Travis does: downloads your code,
installs it on a Windows machine, with various versions of python, and runs the
tests. Appveyor is controlled through another configuration file: the
<code>appveyor.yml</code>. In addition to committing this file into the repository, you
will need to activate Appveyor for your project. This is done by signing into
the Appveyor interface with your Github account, clicking on the "projects" tab
at the top of the page, then clicking on the "+" sign for "New project" and
selecting the project you would like to add from the menu that appears (you
might need to give Appveyor the permission to see projects in your Github
account).</p>
<h3 id="distribution">Distribution</h3>
<hr />
<p>The main venue for distribution of Python software is the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/">Python
Package Index</a>, or PyPI, also lovingly known
as "the cheese-shop". To distribute your software on PyPI, you will need to create a user account on
<a href="http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing/#register-your-project">PyPI</a>.
It is recommended that you upload your software using
<a href="http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distributing/#upload-your-distributions">twine</a>. Using Travis, you can automatically upload your software to PyPI,
every time you push a tag of your software to github. The instructions
on setting this up can be found
<a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi/">here</a>. You will need
to install the travis command-line interface.</p>
<h3 id="source-code">Source Code</h3>
<hr />
<p>We place the main module for the source code in a file called <code>package_name.py</code>
in directory called <code>package_name</code>. This structure is a bit confusing at first,
but it is a simple way to create a structure where when we type <code>import
package_name as pkg</code> in an interactive Python session, the classes and
functions defined inside of the <code>package_name.py</code> file are available in the
<code>pkg</code> namespace. For this to work, we need to also create a file in
<code>__init__.py</code> which contains code that imports everything in that file into the
namespace of the project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from .package_name import *
</code></pre>
<p>In the module code, we follow the convention that all functions are either
imported from other places, or are defined in lines that precede the lines that
use that function. This helps readability of the code, because you know that if
you see some name, the definition of that name will appear earlier in the file,
either as a function/variable definition, or as an import from some other module
or package.</p>
<h3 id="version-control">Version Control</h3>
<hr />
<p><img alt="code style" src="git.png" /></p>
<p>Source code versioning control is managed with git. Currently there are two
files in the repository which help working with this repository, and which you
could extend further:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.gitignore</code> -- specifies intentionally untracked files (such as
  compiled <code>*.pyc</code> files), which should not typically be committed to
  git (see <code>man gitignore</code>)</li>
<li><code>.mailmap</code> -- if any of the contributors used multiple names/email
  addresses or his git commit identity is just an alias, you could
  specify the ultimate name/email(s) for each contributor, so such
  commands as <code>git shortlog -sn</code> could take them into account (see
  <code>git shortlog --help</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Keep secrets and configuration out of version control</strong>. You <em>really</em> don't
want to leak your AWS secret key or Postgres username and password on Github.
Enough said — see the <a href="http://12factor.net/config">Twelve Factor App</a>
principles on this point. One solution is to create a <code>.env</code> file in the
project root folder. Thanks to the <code>.gitignore</code>, this file should never get
committed into the version control repository. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nohighlight"># example .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=myaccesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=mysecretkey
OTHER_VARIABLE=something
</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the stub script in <code>package_name/data/make_dataset.py</code>, it uses
a package called <a href="https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv">python-dotenv</a> to
load up all the entries in this file as environment variables so they are
accessible with <code>os.environ.get</code>. Here's an example snippet adapted from the
<code>python-dotenv</code> documentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># src/data/dotenv_example.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

# find .env automagically by walking up directories until it's found
dotenv_path = find_dotenv()

# load up the entries as environment variables
load_dotenv(dotenv_path)

database_url = os.environ.get(&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;)
other_variable = os.environ.get(&quot;OTHER_VARIABLE&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<hr />
<p>Don't ever edit your raw data, especially not manually, and especially not in
Excel. Don't overwrite your raw data. Don't save multiple versions of the raw
data. Treat the data (and its format) as immutable. The code you write should
move the raw data through a pipeline to your final analysis. You shouldn't have
to run all of the steps every time you want to make a new figure, but anyone
should be able to reproduce the final products with only the code in <code>src</code> and
the data in <code>data/raw</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis is a DAG</strong>. Often in an analysis you have long-running steps that
preprocess data or train models. If these steps have been run already (and you
have stored the output somewhere like the <code>data/interim</code> directory), you don't
want to wait to rerun them every time. We prefer
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/"><code>make</code></a> for managing steps that depend on
each other, especially the long-running ones. Make is a common tool on
Unix-based platforms (and is available for Windows). Following the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/"><code>make</code>
documentation</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html#Makefile-Conventions">Makefile
conventions</a>,
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Portable-Make.html#Portable-Make">portability
guide</a>
will help ensure your Makefiles work effectively across systems. Here are
<a href="http://zmjones.com/make/">some</a>
<a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/15/make-for-data-scientists/">examples</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206054212/http://www.bioinformaticszen.com/post/decomplected-workflows-makefiles/">get
started</a>.
A number of data folks use <code>make</code> as their tool of choice, including <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/make/">Mike
Bostock</a>. There are other tools for managing
DAGs that are written in Python instead of a DSL (e.g.,
<a href="http://paver.github.io/paver/#">Paver</a>,
<a href="http://luigi.readthedocs.org/en/stable/index.html">Luigi</a>,
<a href="https://airflow.apache.org/index.html">Airflow</a>,
<a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Snakemake</a>,
<a href="http://www.ruffus.org.uk/">Ruffus</a>, or
<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/memory.html">Joblib</a>). Feel free to use these
if they are more appropriate for your analysis.</p>
<p>Also, if data is immutable, it doesn't need source control in the same way that
code does. Therefore, <strong><em>by default, the data folder is included in the
<code>.gitignore</code> file.</em></strong> If you have a small amount of data that rarely changes,
you may want to include the data in the repository. Github currently warns if
files are over 50MB and rejects files over 100MB. Some other options for
storing/syncing large data include <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a> with a
syncing tool (e.g., <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd"><code>s3cmd</code></a>), <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git Large File
Storage</a>, <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/">Git
Annex</a>, and <a href="http://dat-data.com/">dat</a>.
Currently by default, we support instantiating a S3 bucket and use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/index.html">AWS
CLI</a> to sync
data in the <code>data</code> folder with the server (you can also sync data from a local
server).</p>
<p><strong>AWS CLI configuration</strong>. When using Amazon S3 to store data, a simple method
of managing AWS access is to set your access keys to environment variables.
However, managing mutiple sets of keys on a single machine (e.g. when working
on multiple projects) it is best to use a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html">credentials
file</a>,
typically located in <code>~/.aws/credentials</code>. A typical file might look like:</p>
<pre><code>[default]
aws_access_key_id=myaccesskey
aws_secret_access_key=mysecretkey

[another_project]
aws_access_key_id=myprojectaccesskey
aws_secret_access_key=myprojectsecretkey
</code></pre>
<p>You can add the profile name when initialising a project; assuming no
applicable environment variables are set, the profile credentials will be used
by default.</p>
<p>Finally, a handy code snippet to get the standard file-system location for the
<code>data</code> folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os.path as op
from pathlib import Path
import package_name as pkg
root = Path(pkg.__path__[0]).parent.absolute()
data_path = op.join(root, 'data')
</code></pre>
<h3 id="styling">Styling</h3>
<hr />
<p><img alt="code style" src="code-style.png" /></p>
<p>Remember that code will be probably be read more times than it will be written.
Make it easy to read (for others, but also for yourself when you come back to
it), by following a consistent formatting style. We strongly recommend
following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8 code formatting
standard</a>, and we enforce this by
running a code-linter called <code>flake8</code> (it combines the tools <code>pep8</code> and
<code>pyflakes</code>), which automatically checks the code and reports any violations of
the PEP8 standard (and checks for other general code hygiene issues).</p>
<p>Some projects include <code>flake8</code> inside their automated tests, so that every pull
request is examined for code cleanliness. In this project, we have run <code>flake8</code>
most (but not all) files, on most (but not all) checks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">flake8 --ignore N802,N806 `find . -name *.py | grep -v setup.py | grep -v /doc/`
</code></pre>
<p>This means, check all .py files, but exclude setup.py and everything in
directories named "docs". Do all checks except N802 and N806, which enforce
lowercase-only names for variables and functions.</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> contains an instruction for running this command as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">make flake8
</code></pre>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<hr />
<p>Documenting your software is a good idea. Not only as a way to communicate to
others about how to use the software, but also as a way of reminding yourself
what the issues are that you faced, and how you dealt with them, in a few
months/years, when you return to look at the code.</p>
<p>The first step in this direction is to document every function in your module
code. We recommend following the <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt">numpy docstring
standard</a>,
which specifies in detail the inputs/outputs of every function, and specifies
how to document additional details, such as references to scientific articles,
notes about the mathematics behind the implementation, etc.</p>
<p>This standard also plays well with a system that allows you to create more
comprehensive documentation of your project. Writing such documentation allows
you to provide more elaborate explanations of the decisions you made when you
were developing the software, as well as provide some examples of usage,
explanations of the relevant scientific concepts, and references to the relevant
literature.</p>
<p>To document <code>package_name</code> we use the <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">sphinx documentation
system</a>. You can follow the instructions on the sphinx
website, and the example <a href="http://matplotlib.org/sampledoc/">here</a> to set up the
system, but we have also already initialized and commited a skeleton
documentation system in the <code>docs</code> directory, that you can build upon.</p>
<p>Sphinx uses a <code>Makefile</code> to build different outputs of your documentation. For
example, if you want to generate the HTML rendering of the documentation (web
pages that you can upload to a website to explain the software), you will type:</p>
<pre><code>make html
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate a set of static webpages in the <code>docs/_build/html</code>, which you
can then upload to a website of your choice.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://readthedocs.org">readthedocs.org</a> (careful,
<em>not</em> readthedocs.<strong>com</strong>) is a service that will run sphinx for you,
and upload the documentation to their website. To use this service,
you will need to register with RTD. After you have done that, you will
need to "import your project" from your github account, through the
RTD web interface. To make things run smoothly, you also will need to
go to the "admin" panel of the project on RTD, and navigate into the
"advanced settings" so that you can tell it that your Python
configuration file is in <code>docs/conf.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<hr />
<p><img alt="Bug" src="bug.png" /></p>
<p>Most scientists who write software constantly test their code. That is, if you
are a scientist writing software, I am sure that you have tried to see how well
your code works by running every new function you write, examining the inputs
and the outputs of the function, to see if the code runs properly (without
error), and to see whether the results make sense.</p>
<p>Automated code testing takes this informal practice, makes it formal, and
automates it, so that you can make sure that your code does what it is supposed
to do, even as you go about making changes around it.</p>
<p>Most scientists writing code are not really in a position to write a complete
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/01/code-bugs-programming-why-we-need-specs/">specification</a>
of their software, because when they start writing their code they don't quite
know what they will discover in their data, and these chance discoveries might
affect how the software evolves. Nor do most scientists have the inclination to
write complete specs - scientific code often needs to be good enough to cover
our use-case, and not any possible use-case. Testing the code serves as a way to
provide a reader of the code with very rough specification, in the sense that it
at least specifies certain input/output relationships that will certainly hold
in your code.</p>
<p>We recommend using the <a href="http://pytest.org/latest/">'pytest'</a> library for
testing. The <code>py.test</code> application traverses the directory tree in which it is
issued, looking for files with the names that match the pattern <code>test_*.py</code>
(typically, something like our <code>package_name/tests/test_package_name.py</code>). Within each
of these files, it looks for functions with names that match the pattern
<code>test_*</code>. Typically each function in the module would have a corresponding test
(e.g. <code>test_transform_data</code>). This is sometimes called 'unit testing', because
it independently tests each atomic unit in the software. Other tests might run a
more elaborate sequence of functions ('end-to-end testing' if you run through
the entire analysis), and check that particular values in the code evaluate to
the same values over time. This is sometimes called 'regression testing'.
Regressions in the code are often canaries in the coal mine, telling you that
you need to examine changes in your software dependencies, the platform on
which you are running your software, etc.</p>
<p>Test functions should contain assertion statements that check certain relations
in the code. Most typically, they will test for equality between an explicit
calculation of some kind and a return of some function. We recommend using
functions from the <code>numpy.testing</code> module (which we import as <code>npt</code>) to assert
certain relations on arrays and floating point numbers. This is because <code>npt</code>
contains functions that are specialized for handling <code>numpy</code> arrays, and they
allow to specify the tolerance of the comparison through the <code>decimal</code> key-word
argument.</p>
<p>To run the tests on the command line, change your present working directory to
the top-level directory of the repository (e.g. <code>/home/user/code/package_name</code>),
and type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">py.test package_name
</code></pre>
<p>This will exercise all of the tests in your code directory. If a test fails, you
will see a message such as:</p>
<pre><code>package_name/tests/test_package_name.py .F...

=================================== FAILURES ===================================

.
.
.


E       AssertionError:

.
.
.

package_name/tests/test_package_name.py:49: AssertionError
====================== 1 failed, 4 passed in 0.82 seconds ======================
</code></pre>
<p>As your code grows and becomes more complicated, you might develop new features
that interact with your old features in all kinds of unexpected and surprising
ways. As you develop new features of your code, keep running the tests, to make
sure that you haven't broken the old features.  Keep writing new tests for your
new code, and recording these tests in your testing scripts. That way, you can
be confident that even as the software grows, it still keeps doing correctly at
least the few things that are codified in the tests.</p>
<p>We have also provided a <code>Makefile</code> that allows you to run the tests with more
verbose and informative output from the top-level directory, by issuing the
following from the command line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">make test
</code></pre>
<h3 id="notebooks">Notebooks</h3>
<hr />
<p><img alt="code style" src="notebooks.png" /></p>
<p>Notebook packages like the <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>, <a href="http://beakernotebook.com/">Beaker notebook</a>, <a href="http://zeppelin-project.org/">Zeppelin</a>, and other literate programming tools are very effective for exploratory data analysis. Hence, the notebooks directory can be used as a place to experiment with your module code, and as a place to produce scripts that contain a narrative structure, demonstrating the use of the code, or producing scientific results from your code and your data and telling a story with these elements. For example, an IPython notebook that reads in some data, and creates a figure. Maybe this is <em>Figure 1</em> from some future article?</p>
<p>When we use notebooks in our work, we often subdivide the <code>notebooks</code> folder. For example, <code>notebooks/exploratory</code> contains initial explorations, whereas <code>notebooks/reports</code> is more polished work that can be exported as html to the <code>reports</code> directory.</p>
<p>Since notebooks are challenging objects for source control (e.g., diffs of the <code>json</code> are often not human-readable and merging is near impossible), we recommended not collaborating directly with others on Jupyter notebooks. There are two steps we recommend for using notebooks effectively:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Follow a naming convention that shows the owner and the order the analysis was done in. We use the format <code>&lt;step&gt;-&lt;ghuser&gt;-&lt;description&gt;.ipynb</code> (e.g., <code>1.0-ed-visualize-distributions.ipynb</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactor the good parts. Don't write code to do the same task in multiple notebooks. If it's a data preprocessing task, put it in the pipeline at <code>package_name/data/make_dataset.py</code> and load data from <code>data/interim</code>. If it's useful utility code, refactor it to <code>package_name</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, by default we turn the project into a Python package (see the <code>setup.py</code> file). You can import your code and use it in notebooks with a cell like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># OPTIONAL: Load the &quot;autoreload&quot; extension so that code can change
%load_ext autoreload

# OPTIONAL: always reload modules so that as you change code in src, it gets loaded
%autoreload 2

from package_name.data import make_dataset
</code></pre>
<h3 id="licensing">Licensing</h3>
<hr />
<p>License your code! A repository like this without a license maintains
copyright to the author, but does not provide others with any
conditions under which they can use the software. In this case, we use
the MIT license. You can read the conditions of the license in the
<code>LICENSE</code> file. As you can see, this is not an Apple software license
agreement (has anyone ever actually tried to read one of those?). It's
actually all quite simple, and boils down to "You can do whatever you
want with my software, but I take no responsibility for what you do
with my software"</p>
<p>For more details on what you need to think about when considering
choosing a license, see this

<h3 id="getting-cited">Getting cited</h3>
<hr />
<p>When others use your code in their research, they should probably cite you. To
make their life easier, we use <a href="http://www.duecredit.org">duecredit</a>. This is a software
library that allows you to annotate your code with the correct way to cite it.
To enable <code>duecredit</code>, we have added a file <code>due.py</code> into the main directory.
This file does not need to change at all (though you might want to occasionally
update it from duecredit itself. It's
<a href="https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/blob/master/duecredit/stub.py">here</a>,
under the name <code>stub.py</code>).</p>
<p>In addition, you will want to provide a digital object identifier (DOI) to the
article you want people to cite.</p>
<p>To get a DOI, use the instructions in <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">this page</a></p>
<p>Another way to get your software cited is by writing a paper. There are several
<a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software">journals that publish papers about software</a>.</p>
